# Vinderman

A package that can be used to interact with the epic games api, with a specific focus around fortnite services. Named after the mysterious Dr. Vinderman from the campaign mode of the game.
Currently the client does not store auth or any state, as the primary purpose of the library is to be used in my fortnite utility bot that doesnt cache sessions; however, at a later point this will be implemented.

- Installation: `go get gitlab.com/8h9x/Vinderman`
